This project implements the code for "Detecting Accessibility Barriers with YOLO Models and Faster R-CNNs" by Allison Casasola and Amanda Rodriguez.

CITATIONS - This project used the following resources permitted by the CS231n Honor Code:
- Rishabh Singh's "Understanding and Implementing Faster R-CNN" (2024): https://medium.com/@RobuRishabh/understanding-and-implementing-faster-r-cnn-248f7b25ff96
    This was used to implement Faster R-CNN with an RPN in PyTorch.
- Ultralytics YOLO Docs: https://docs.ultralytics.com/
    This was used to implement and evaluate YOLO.
- ChatGPT and Cursor
    These tools were used to aid code implementation and debugging.
